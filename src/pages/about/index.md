### Hi and welcome to my personal space on the internet.

My name is Calin-Cristian Ciubotariu and I am a software developer specialised in mobile technologies. 

I developed a wide variety of mobile apps and took part in projects ranging from advertising and social to event planning and mobile payments. 

I love building things from scratch, being part of designing, outlining architectures, implementation and the challenges of developing for scalability and maintainability.

I write code every day - so I started this blog to take notes for future references and improve myself by sharing knowledge.

When I'm not coding, I like cycling, craft beers, whiskey and going to rock concerts with my wife.
