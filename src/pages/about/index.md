### Hi and welcome to my personal space on the internet.

My name is Calin-Cristian Ciubotariu and I am a software developer specialized in developing mobile apps.



First of all, I write code every day - so I started this blog to take notes for future references and improve myself by sharing knowledge.



Other than that, I like cycling, craft beers, whiskey, metal music and my hair :)
